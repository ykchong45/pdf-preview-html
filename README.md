This is a example repo if you want to host your PDF as your Github page.

First you need to have a publically accessible pdf file, and a share link to it.

Please change `src="https://docs.google.com/gview?url=https://path.to.your.pdf&embedded=true"` in the code.

Follow [Github page instructions](https://pages.github.com/) to deploy this repo.
